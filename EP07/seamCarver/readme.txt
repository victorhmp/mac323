Programming Assignment 7: Seam Carving


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely your algorithm to compute the horizontal and
 *  vertical seam. 
 *****************************************************************************/



/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe what makes an image ideal for this seamCarving algorithm and what
 *   kind of image would not work well.
 *****************************************************************************/





/******************************************************************************
 *  Give a formula (using tilde notation) for the running time (in seconds)
 *  required to reduce the image by one row and a second formula for the
 *  running time to reduce the image by one column. Both should be functions
 *  of W and H. Reducing the image by one row/column involves exactly one
 *  call to the appropriate find() method and one call to the corresponding
 *  remove() method.
 * 
 *  Justify your answer experimentally. To do so, fill in the two tables
 *  below. Each table must have 4-10 data points. Do not include data points
 *  that takes less than 0.5 seconds. To dampen system effects, you may 
 *  perform many trials for a given value of W and H and average the results.
 *  
 *  For the leading coefficients and exponents, use 2 digits after the
 *  decimal point. Show your calculations.
